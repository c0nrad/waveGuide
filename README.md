WaveGuide
============

The idea is to build a waveguide model to be used to build quantum logic gates. The model is being built using [MEEP](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Meep), with minor scripts written in python2.7 and modeling done in mayavi2.

The current design of the waveguide is as follows:
